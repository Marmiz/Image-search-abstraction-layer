# Image Abstraction Layer
a small project for Free Code Camp back-end curriculum.

---
## What's this?

A simple program where I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.

---

## Usage

By visiting `api/imagesearch/<your search>`
You will see a default Json with the 10 most relevant images.

You can set the offset to paginate trough the response
`api/imagesearch/<your search>?offset=<number>`

And you can see the most recent search history by visiting:
`api/latest/imagesearch`.

You can see it live [here](https://imagesearch-abstraction-layer.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku.
